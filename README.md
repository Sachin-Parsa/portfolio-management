# Stock Market Portfolio Management with Time Series and Sentiment Analysis

Stock market prediction is one of the oldest and most challenging tasks, it has caused the creation of the Fintech industry which is now more than a $100 billion industry. There are so many microeconomics and macroeconomic concepts that determine the movement of stocks. I hypothesize that taking the historic performance of stock, public sentiment and reducing your risk are some of the most influential reasons for stock movements. In the project, the objective is to make an optimal stock portfolio using machine learning concepts like time series analysis, sentiment analysis and clustering to filter the best stocks. Then we use a portfolio optimization technique by minimizing the Sharpe ratio to reduce the risk and maximize return on investment. This strategy is tested by creating a portfolio for October of 2022 and comparing the performance of the portfolio with the performance of the S & P 500 index.
